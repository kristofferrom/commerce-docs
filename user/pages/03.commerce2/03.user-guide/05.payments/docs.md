Unless you are creating a manual payment gateway, a payment module should be installed before proceeding to config a payment gateway at /admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways.

When configuring a payment gateway first click 'Add payment gateway'. Then select your gateway of choice from the plugin list and configure the remaining fields.
